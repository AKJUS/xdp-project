#+TITLE: People involved in XDP development

* Intro

Lets record people involved on XDP development.
Need this to Cc the right people on the mailing list.

* History

The early "moonshot" ideas behind having a step before allocating the
SKB, was presented by Jesper at NetDev 1.1 (Feb 2016), who also did
PoC experiments (with mlx5) extrapolating a performance could reach
19Mpps per core. Today we are seeing between 16Mpps to 24Mpps per core
depending on which NIC HW used (mlx5 driver).

The initial XDP patchset was developed by:
 Brenden Blanco <bblanco@gmail.com> / <bblanco@vmware.com>
After this Brenden have not been active developing XDP.

The XDP name was coined by Tom Herbert.  Tom Herbert and Alexei
Starovoitov did the first presentation about XDP, while both working
for Facebook.
