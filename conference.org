This document is use for /Conference/ *project management*, and contains *tasks*
via org-mode =TODO=, =NEXT= and =DONE= tags. (This file is placed at this level
for our org-mode setup to pick it up). Each conference have a top-level =TODO=,
causing our [[file:org-setup.el][org-mode setup]] =org-agenda= view to pickup these tasks as
[[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#TodoKeywordProjectTaskStates][Projects and Stuck Projects]].

XDP is an increasingly popular topic and technology.
XDP builds on top of eBPF.

This hands-on tutorial will provide guidance on
getting started using XDP+eBPF technology with
intention to let attendees for later
leveraging it for your specific use-case.

More details to be posted later.

We need a github repo that are easier to build than [[https://github.com/netoptimizer/prototype-kernel][prototype-kernel]] github
repo, as it requires the kernel source tree to build. The hands-on tutorial
need to have an easier and more confined build-environment.

Started repo here: https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/

- Don't replicate kernel state
- How to handle multiple programs on one interface

** DONE XDP-tutorial: Do a real presentation or not?

Question is if we need a real presentation for the XDP-tutorial, or if the
GitHub READMEs are enough?

Summary after meeting (with Toke):
Yes we will need a presentation: But mostly as a 10 minute intro.

Afterwards the presenters laptop can open the README files, as this will
show what is the current exercise. And we want people to open these
README.org files themselves, either via GitHub-webpage or in emacs.

The presentation will be placed in: [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-project/tree/master/conference/NetDevConf2019-0x13][xdp-project git-repo]].

The reason behind *not* placing it in: [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial][xdp-tutorial git-repo]],
is that we want to evolve the xdp-tutorial without tying it to a specific
conference. We will create a git-tag (or branch) that correspond to the
conference presentation, to allow people link the two.

Brainstorm over topics in presentation:
- Initial slides.
- Reference to vikings
- Cover global readme
- About the veth-testlab setup
  * required kernel version
- Offer to help people with their own use-cases
