#+TITLE: Finding ARM64 hardware for XDP project

XDP does in principle work on ARM
 - Drivers: cavium/thunderx
 - But upstream XDP developers don't have HW to test/improve

XDP is centered around support in the NIC driver.  Thus, this search for
suitable ARM64 developement boards, order the document after the NIC driver and
finds boards that have the NIC hardware corresponding to the driver.

NIC drivers and corresponding ARM64 boards:

* Driver: mvneta

(mvneta) Board#1: *ClearFog*
 - (ARMADA 38x SoC) from Marvell
 - single or dual core ARMv7 (Cortex A9) @ up to 1.6 GHz with 1MB L2 cache (32bit)
