This document contains *org-mode tasks* and TODOs for files under: [[file:mem/][areas/mem/]].
It is recommended to use emacs when viewing and editing these =.org= files, as
the github rendering view removes the =TODO= and =DONE= marking on the tasks.

When delaying freeing the registered XDP memory model, then we cannot have
drivers calling page_pool_destroy() directly. Figure out a clean code way to do
this.

** TODO page_pool inflight: howto delay/postpone work in kernel

What is the best way to delay taking down page_pool object when driver calls
xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model(), in the case page_pool detect/have in-flight
frames?

Should we create a workqueue?
#+begin_src C
#include <linux/workqueue.h>
static struct workqueue_struct *wq;
wq = alloc_workqueue("xdp_mem_dismantle_wq", 0, 0);
struct work_struct free_work; // embed in struct xdp_mem_allocator?
INIT_WORK(&free_work, __unreg_mem_model_schedule);
queue_work(wq, &free_work);
queue_delayed_work(wq, struct delayed_work *dwork, delay);
#+end_src

It might be overkill to create a new workqueue, what about instead using the
default worker thread 'events/n'.

The function calls used instead of =queue_work= and =queue_delayed_work=.
#+begin_src C
schedule_work(wq);
schedule_delayed_work(wq, delay);
#+end_src

There is an example in function =amba_deferred_retry_func()= how to reschedule
the work-queue function from itself via =schedule_delayed_work=.

** TODO Create tracepoints for page_pool

** TODO Create bpftrace scripts monitoring page_pool stats (via tracepoints)
