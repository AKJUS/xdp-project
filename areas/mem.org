This document contains *org-mode tasks* and TODOs for files under: [[file:mem/][areas/mem/]].
It is recommended to use emacs when viewing and editing these =.org= files, as
the github rendering view removes the =TODO= and =DONE= marking on the tasks.

Top-level headings indicate category, as explained in [[file:../xdp-project.org]].
