#+TITLE: DMA issues that affect XDP

The CONFIG_RETPOLINE kernel config caused a huge regression for XDP benchmarks.
Primary for caused by an increase cost for the DMA calls, which uses indirect
calls.  The DMA-sync call happens just before the BPF prog is invoked.  But it
is primary XDP_REDIRECT which is affected as it (currently) cannot hide the DMA
call (TX-map calls).
