* Important medium-term tasks                                       :@medium:
** TODO Expanding XDP_REDIRECT support to more drivers

Very few drivers support XDP_REDIRECT.

HW drivers: ixgbe, i40e, mlx5, netsec, mvneta, mvpp2

SW drivers: veth, tun (tuntap), virtio_net

*** NEXT Map out redirect support in drivers and make a plan

It would be useful with a complete list drivers that are missing some or all
parts of REDIRECT support. Based on this we can make a plan for what to do about
each of these.

*** TODO What to do about failing REDIRECT
[[id:760b03fc-2a8e-499c-a90c-74dbc4716cbc][Handling XDP_REDIRECT failures]]

*** TODO Queueing

** WAIT Adding XDP support to new drivers

Waiting for page pool work

*** TODO Driver support for sfc driver

**** NEXT Sync with Edward Cree et al

*** TODO Driver support for Marvell mvpp2
