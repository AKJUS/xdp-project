#+TITLE: Project management for XDP-tutorial
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

This document contains *org-mode tasks* and TODOs for [[: https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/][XDP-tutorial]].
It is recommended to use emacs when viewing and editing these =.org= files,
as the github rendering view removes the =TODO= and =DONE= marking on the
tasks.

The XDP-tutorial is more than a tutorial. We want to evolve this to become a
resource for XDP/BPF developer to learn good programming practices. This
also means aspiring to high code quality, and show good practise for error
handling, and show how code are placed into common/ directory files/objects.

* TODO XDP-tutorial ideas for assignments/examples

** TODO xdp-tutorial: Work on AF_XDP tutorial example
The [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/tree/master/advanced03-AF_XDP][advanced03-AF_XDP]] lesson needs more work.

** TODO Example of how to use tail calls

** TODO xdp-tutorial: Split packet parsing between two XDP programs

This exercise/lesson is also meant to show how XDP hardware offloading can
interact with regular XDP programs (software mode running driver level).

The assignment is to create two XDP programs. The first XDP-prog does packet
header parsing, and store parse information in metadata area (located just
before payload) and BPF tail-call second XDP-prog. The second XDP-prog reads
info from metadata area, and act on parse-info, e.g. show it can read part
of the packet, without doing parsing. The tricky part of the second XDP-prog
is how can the verifiers static analysis proof safety.


*** TODO xdp-tutorial: Extend to HW-offload: Split packet parsing between two XDP programs

When above assignment is complete. Then extend to HW-offload the first
XDP-prog that does the parsing and storing in metadata area. It doesn't BPF
tail-call the second XDP-prog, instead load the second XDP-prog in regular
XDP driver hook.

This will demonstrate howto HW-offload packet header parse information via
metadata area.


* TODO xdp-tutorial for tracepoints project

Tutorial sub-project for teaching people about using tracepoints.

The XDP angle is that infra depend on some tracepoints for stats, debugging
and troubleshooting XDP. E.g. see the kernel/samples/bpf program xdp_monitor
([[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/samples/bpf/xdp_monitor_kern.c][xdp_monitor_kern.c]] and [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/samples/bpf/xdp_monitor_user.c][xdp_monitor_user.c]]). But the issue is that
xdp_monitor (and other trace samples) use another ELF loader than libbpf
(the samples local [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/samples/bpf/bpf_load.c][bpf_load.c]]), which we want to move people way from.

** TODO xdp-tutorial: add tracepoint examples for reading XDP tracepoints

Tutorial already covers load BPF programs, but attaching to tracepoints need
to be covered by tutorial. Attaching to tracepoints is a multi-step process,
that involves reading an id from debugfs, using sys_perf_event_open, and
calling some =ioctl()= events.

Ultimately we should consider adding to libbpf, tracepoint attach helper
functions, to hide these multi-step attach steps. For the purpose of the
tutorial we can demonstrate the steps, and have several tracing0x
assignments that abstract and generalise this.  Notice functions that we
consider upstreaming to libbpf are placed in [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/blob/master/common/common_libbpf.c][common/common_libbpf.c]].

Another consideration: We should promote using raw_tracepoints for BPF as it
have much less overhead for getting info that BPF need.

** TODO xdp-tutorial: relate tracing to other assignments

When building up tracing assignments relate this to other parts of tutorial.

We can already relate this to other assignments. The assignment [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/tree/master/basic02-prog-by-name#assignment-2-add-xdp_abort-program][basic02]] show
how to use perf record + script with tracepoint event =xdp:xdp_exception=.
And basic04 program have a "xdp_abort" section program, that can trigger
this tracepoint.

* TODO xdp-tutorial: selftests project

We would like to have a system that (integrated with Makefile) that can run
a selftest per assignment directory.

* TODO XDP-tutorial misc assignments

** TODO XDP-tutorial: Code xdp_stats to use/follow XDP bpf-id to maps

Update basic04 xdp_stats via XDP-id

** TODO XDP-tutorial: drawing and desc of veth-testlab
** TODO Best practices for using multiple programs on the same interface
