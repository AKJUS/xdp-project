* Initial benchmark results

** Baseline: Intel CPU E5-1650

Copying the baseline for Intel CPU E5-1650 we got from
[[file:traits02_optimizations.org]] that originates [[file:traits01_bench_kmod.org]]:

Cost of normal function call
 - 4 cycles(tsc) 1.266 ns

Cost of indirect function (pointer) call
 - 30 cycles(tsc) 8.463 ns
 - this large overhead is caused by Mitigation: Retpolines

Cost of calling =bpf_xdp_trait_set=
 - 42 cycles(tsc) 11.849 ns

Cost of calling =bpf_xdp_trait_get=
 - 29 cycles(tsc) 8.056 ns
