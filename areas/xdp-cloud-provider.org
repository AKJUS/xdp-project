#+TITLE: Project management for XDP Cloud-Provider use-case
#+CATEGORY: Cloud
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

A solid use-case for XDP is redirection into guest VMs. As this allows a
packet destined for a VM to skip the entire overhead of the Host-OS network
stack.  The Host-OS still sees the packet at the XDP layer which allow for
implementing and enforcing per VM policies.

For a Cloud Provider this could (1) save significant amount of CPU resources
in the Host-OS, and (2) increase the throughput (pps) performance into a
Guest VM.
