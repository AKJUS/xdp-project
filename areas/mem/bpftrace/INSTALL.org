#+Title: Installing bpftrace and manage with stow
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

The bpftrace official compile from git-tree guide is [[https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/INSTALL.md#generic-build-process][here]].

This document is mostly a guide, howto make =cmake= install the files under
=/usr/local/stow/=, to ease management of different versions via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU stow]].

* Guide: Step-by-step

** Clone git-repo

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace
#+end_src

** Compile and install

Control the =cmake= install path via =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.

Regarding 'stow', consider creating direcory =/usr/local/stow/= with write
permissions for your own user (or admin group), and restrict write
permissions for =/usr/local/= as this prevents =make install= to install
files outside the =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= path.

Start in git repository directory:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir build ; cd build ;
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/bpftrace-git01 ..
make
make install
#+end_src

** Use stow

The bpftrace binaries have been installed into direcory
=/usr/local/stow/bpftrace-git01= (from above procedure).

As =/usr/local/= is a system-wide location, we want to keep track and be
able to "uninstall" software installed in this location. For this task we
use the tool called 'stow' (official [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU project]]).

For symlink "installing" bpftrace this is the procedure:
#+begin_src sh
cd /usr/local/stow/
sudo stow bpftrace-git01
#+end_src

For symlink "uninstall":
#+begin_src sh
cd /usr/local/stow/
sudo stow -D bpftrace-git01
#+end_src
