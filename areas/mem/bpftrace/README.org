#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

This directory contains some tracing tools based on [[https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace][bpftrace]], which is a
high-level tracing language for Linux eBPF.

* Troubleshooting

These scripts depend on bpftrace features in versions higher than v0.9.2.
As of this writing, no official version above v0.9.2, have been released.
Thus, you have to [[https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/INSTALL.md][install latest bpftrace]] GitHub version.

We provide a local quick-guide here: [[file:INSTALL.org]]
