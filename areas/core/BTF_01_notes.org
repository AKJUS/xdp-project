#+Title: BTF (Bpf Type Format) notes
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

The BPF Type Format (BTF) is a really cool feature that allows us to
describe data types used in e.g. BPF-maps (both key and value).

The [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html#bpf-type-format-btf][kernel BTF documentation]] is all about encoding details, and not about
how to use BTF.

This is my notes for trying to understand how to use BTF
*from within the kernel*.
