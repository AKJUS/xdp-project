#+Title: XDP multi buffer design

This document is a serious attempt to find a way to support multi-buffer
packets with XDP. With the important criteria of not hurting performance of
the single-buffer per packet design.

Keywords: xdp vs. jumbo-frame, TSO/LRO, packet header split

* Why XDP don't have multi-buffer support

XDP is designed for maximum performance, which is why certain driver-level
use-cases were not supported, like multi-buffer packets (like jumbo-frames).
As it e.g. complicated the driver RX-loop and memory model handling.

The single buffer per packet design, is also tied into eBPF Direct-Access
(DA) to packet data, which can only be allowed if the packet memory is in
contiguous memory.  This DA feature is essential for XDP performance.

* Use-cases for multi-buffer

What are the use-cases for multi-buffer packets:
- Jumbo-frames
- Packet header split
- TSO/LRO
