#+TITLE: Brainstorm notes

This doc is for brainstorming.  Watch out for likely duplicates, clean
them up progressively. 

Turn these notes into real issue or bug descriptions and move them
into other docs like file:/~/git/xdp-notes/xdp_issues.org

* DMA mapping xdp_frame

Keeping DMA mapping in XDP return API.


* BUG: CPUMAP not working for generic-xdp

* Generic-xdp how-to assure NAPI protect?

* Make bulk work for generic xdp with devmap

* Rx+tx ifconfig count update for xdp

* Meta data implement missing for many drivers

* Should we standardize ethtool stats for xdp?

* Adding and removing ethtool channels runtime semantics?
(Jakub question this)

* TODO Implement CPUMAP redirect with connection hashing over CPUs

* Frame to skb, missing csum hw info

(Plus other info)

* Frame to skb, use full headroom

* BUG: Generic-XDP does not work for TCP (in certain cases)


* Potential-bug: Mlx5 fix dma unmap call (after xdp return frame)

* Retpoline performance issue for xdp


* Old list: watch out for dublicates

Old list of stuff I need to work-on/fix for XDP/bpf project:
 * XDP return frame API (needed by AF_XDP ZC)
 * Bulking API for return frame API
 * Bulking API for ndo_xdp_xmit
 * Address massive XDP regression due to CONFIG_RETPOLINE
 * Introduce bulking for generic-XDP (PoC test show +30% perf!!!)
 * Fix CPUMAP to work with generic-XDP
 * Implement ndo_xdp_xmit for macvlan (fast guest delivery)
 * Improve BPF doc
 * Improve XDP doc
 * Work on XDP article with Toke+Alexei+Daniel
 * Better integration of XDP in Suricata (multiple small thing)
 * Find XDP feature/capability API (use in Suricata)
 * Help integrate AF_XDP in Suricata
 * Ship bpftool in distros (start with static linked libbpf)
 * Make libbpf a shared lib in distros (fix lib versioning)
 * Help (Ahern) get XDP route/FIB lookup helper integrated
 * Work on bridge FIB table lookup helper
 * XDP get more info transferred to CPUMAP skb creation time
 * cpumap: GRO support
 * cpumap: RX hash support
 * cpumap: HW csum offload/info
 * Generalize CPUMAP skb creation, move SKB alloc out of driver code
 * Improve XDP cpumap redirect example: flow hashing (fix NIC HW hash)
 * Help get AF_XDP API and performance aligned
 * Help get AF_XDP zero-copy integrated via XDP return API
 * xdp_monitor: improve to show error codes (to easier troubleshoot)
 * convert tracepoint to use ifindex instead of names (strcpy overhead)
 * XDP_REDIRECT: Detect buggy-drivers forgetting to clear per-CPU map
 * Streamline eBPF map-create return codes on errors
 * Upstream xdp_bench01 sample to be standard way to measure XDP perf
 * Fix that TCP traffic with XDP generic on virtual net_devices are broken
 * xdp: avoid leaking info stored in xdp_frame data on page reuse
 * XDP_REDIRECT implemement in every driver
 * XDP data-meta implemement in every driver
 * Improve samples/bpf: XDP progs should take ifconfig/net_device names
 * Improve samples/bpf: Avoid including ./arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h
