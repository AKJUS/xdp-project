* TODO Missing update of ifconfig counters

Progress: @dsahern (David Ahern) have started an email thread on the
subject: [[https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg535239.html][consistency for statistics with XDP mode]]

Some drivers are not updating the "ifconfig" stats counters,
when in XDP mode.  This makes receive or send via XDP invisible to
sysadm/management tools.  This for-sure is going to cause confusion.

Closer look at other drivers.

 - ixgbe driver is doing the right thing.

 - i40e had a bug, where RX/TX stats are swapped (fixed in
   commit [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/cdec2141c24e][cdec2141c24e(v4.20-rc1)]]
   ("i40e: report correct statistics when XDP is enabled")).

 - mlx5 driver is not updating the regular RX/TX counters, but A LOT
   of other ethtool stats counters (which are the ones I usually
   monitor when testing).

** NEXT Figure out the counter semantics upstream
Need to have an upstream discussion, on what is the semantic.  IHMO
the regular RX/TX counters must be updated even for XDP frames.


* TODO Expanding XDP_REDIRECT support to more drivers

Very few drivers support XDP_REDIRECT.

HW drivers: ixgbe, i40e, mlx5

SW drivers: veth, tun (tuntap), virtio_net

** NEXT Map out redirect support in drivers and make a plan

It would be useful with a complete list drivers that are missing some or all
parts of REDIRECT support. Based on this we can make a plan for what to do about
each of these.

* TODO Better ndo_xdp_xmit resource management
:PROPERTIES:
:OWNER:    tohojo
:END:

Driver resources needed to handle a ndo_xdp_xmit() is currently tied
to the driver having loaded an RX XDP program. This is strange, as
allocating these Driver TX HW resources is independent.

This can quickly lead to exhausting HW resources, like IRQs lines or
NIC TX HW queues, given it is assumed a TX queue is alloc/dedicated
for each CPU core.

The main idea for fixing this is to tie resource allocation to interface
insertion into interface maps.

** NEXT Change non-map xdp_redirect helper to use a hidden map

To be able to tie resource allocation to the interface maps, we first need to
change the non-map redirect variant so it uses a map under the hood. Since
xdp_redirect_map() is also significantly faster than the non-map variant, this
change should be a win in itself.

* TODO Usability of programs in samples/bpf - xdp_redirect + xdp_redirect_map

The samples/bpf programs xdp_redirect + xdp_redirect_map are very user
unfriendly.  #1 they use raw ifindex'es as input + output. #2 the
pkt/s number count RX packets, not TX'ed packets which can be dropped
silently.

Red Hat QA, got very confused by #2.

** NEXT Change sample programs to accept ifnames as well as indexes

** NEXT Add TX counters to sample programs

* WAIT BTF-based metadata for XDP

Waiting for tracing people to work out the details of BTF.
