#+TITLE: Top-level XDP project management
#+CATEGORY: XDP
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

This the top-level *XDP project management* file that contains *tasks* via
org-mode =TODO=, =NEXT= and =DONE=. The [[file:areas][areas directory]] also contains
*tasks*. It is recommended to use emacs when viewing and editing these
=.org= files, as the github rendering view removes the =TODO= and =DONE=
marking on the tasks.

Together with the emacs setup in [[file:../org-setup.el]], the extended
=org-agenda= view can be used for project management, and the setup
automatically detect [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#TodoKeywordProjectTaskStates][Projects and Stuck Projects]]. For =org-agenda= view to
pickup these tasks, make sure to [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#AgendaSetup][configure]] =org-agenda-files= to include
this directory and =areas/= directory.

The items in this file are divided into three categories, reflecting the
urgency and time frame we envision them being completed; although this is
somewhat of a soft categorisation, as the development is also dependent on
the priorities of the people and organisations involved. These categories
are:

- Current high-priority tasks (=@short= tag)
- Important medium-term tasks (=@medium= tag)
- Longer-term preliminary plans (=@long= tag)

Tasks are filed under the headings corresponding to these categories below,
and each category contains a description of what it (is supposed to)
include. We also use the tags mentioned above to designate the status, to
allow filtering in agenda views.

* Current high-priority tasks                                        :@short:

These are tasks that are blockers for getting the XDP system ready for
general consumption, i.e., to a state that might reasonably be considered
"feature complete". This means that tasks in this category include essential
pieces of missing functionality, or significant user interface issues that
need to be resolved for wider adoption.

Tasks in this category should have a fleshed-out problem description, and
preferably a plan and someone working on them.

** TODO Consistency for statistics with XDP

The short of it is that we need consistency in the counters across NIC
drivers and virtual devices. Right now stats are specific to a driver with
no clear accounting for the packets and bytes handled in XDP.

Progress: @dsahern (David Ahern) have started an email thread on the
subject: [[https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg535239.html][consistency for statistics with XDP mode]]

*** TODO Missing update of ifconfig counters

Some drivers are not updating the "ifconfig" stats counters,
when in XDP mode.  This makes receive or send via XDP invisible to
sysadm/management tools.  This for-sure is going to cause confusion.

Closer look at other drivers.

 - ixgbe driver is doing the right thing.

 - i40e had a bug, where RX/TX stats are swapped (fixed in
   commit [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/cdec2141c24e][cdec2141c24e(v4.20-rc1)]]
   ("i40e: report correct statistics when XDP is enabled")).

 - mlx5 driver is not updating the regular RX/TX counters, but A LOT
   of other ethtool stats counters (which are the ones I usually
   monitor when testing).

*** NEXT Figure out the counter semantics upstream
Need to have an upstream discussion, on what is the semantic.  IHMO
the regular RX/TX counters must be updated even for XDP frames.

*** TODO Statistics per XDP-action

Accounting per XDP-action is also inconsistent across drivers. Some driver
account nothing, while others have elaborate counters exposed as ethtool
stats.

The common pattern is that XDP programs do their own accounting of action as
they see fit, and export this as BPF maps to their associated userspace
application, which a very per application specific approach.

David Ahern (@dsahern) argues that sysadm's need something more generic and
consistent, as they need a way to diagnose the system, regardless of the XDP
program that some developer asked to get installed. This argument that a 3rd
person should be able to diagnose a running XDP program was generally
accepted upstream.

There were a lot of performance concerns around introducing XDP-action
counters. Generally upstream voices wanted this to be opt-in, e.g. something
that the sysadm explicitly enable when needed, and not default on.

**** NEXT Implement simple XDP-actions counter and measure

As Saeed suggested do something really simple and central like:

side-channel leaking.

And measure if the performance concerns are real or not. Ilias or Jesper can
measure this on a slow ARM64 platform (espressobin), as only testing this on
Intel might lead to the wrong conclusion.

**** TODO Exporting XDP-actions counter to userspace

Collecting XDP-actions counter is only the first step.  We need to figure
out the best solution for exporting this to userspace.

One option is to piggyback on ethtool stats, which the drivers already use,
and it would also standardise the driver related XDP ethool stats.

:END:

Stalled on Intel/Magnus NIC queue management interface.

Driver resources needed to handle a ndo_xdp_xmit() is currently tied
to the driver having loaded an RX XDP program. This is strange, as
allocating these Driver TX HW resources is independent.

This can quickly lead to exhausting HW resources, like IRQs lines or
NIC TX HW queues, given it is assumed a TX queue is alloc/dedicated
for each CPU core.

To be able to tie resource allocation to the interface maps (=devmap=), we

*** TODO Ethtool interface for enabling TX resources
Turns out the initial idea of using insertion into devmap as a trigger for
resource allocation doesn't work because of generic XDP. So we'll need an
ethtool interface; look into the existing channel configuration interface on
the kernel side and figure out how to express XDP resource allocation in a
good way.

**** Interface for defining what a TX resource is
Need to define:

- Number of TX queues
- Algorithm for picking one on a given redirect (e.g., hash on CPU)
- Queueing behaviour

How to handle life cycle management?

*** TODO Add automatic TX resource allocation to libbpf
Because we can't tie resource allocation to map insertion on the kernel
side, we need to solve the UI interface in userspace. So add a hook/wrapper
to libbpf that will automatically allocate TX resources when inserting into
a map.


** TODO XDP feature flags

We are probably going to need feature flags for XDP after all. There are use
cases (e.g. Surricata, VM migration) that will want to know what to expect
from the system before committing to loading an XDP program.

Title:
- Improving the XDP User eXperience: via feature detection

Abstract:
#+begin_quote
The most common asked question is: Does my NIC support XDP, and our current
answer is read the source code. We really need to come up with a better
answer.

The real issue is that users can attach an XDP bpf_prog to a drivers that
use features the driver doesn't implement, which cause silent drops. Or user
doesn't notice, that NIC loading fallback to generic-XDP, which is first
discovered when observing lower performance, or worse not all features are
supported with generic-XDP, resulting in unexpected packet drops.

BPF feature detection, recently added to bpftool, is based on probing the
BPF-core by loading BPF-programs using individual features (notice BPF load
time, not attaching it).

Even if your BPF loader doesn't use feature probing, it will notice if
loaded on a incompatible kernel. As an BPF-prog using something the kernel
BPF-core doesn't support will get rejected at load-time, before you attach
the BPF-prog.

This doesn't work for XDP, as features vary on a per driver basis. Currently
an XDP BPF-prog isn't aware of that driver it will get used on, until driver
attach-time. Unfortunately, due to BPF tail-calls, we cannot use the driver
attach-time hook to check for compatibility (given new XDP BPF-progs can be
indirectly "attached" via tail-call map inserts).

In this talk, we will investigate the possibilities of doing XDP feature
check at BPF load-time, by assigning an ifindex to the BPF-prog. The ground
work have already been laid by XDP hardware offload, which already need
ifindex at BPF load-time (to perform BPF byte-code translation into NIC
compatible code).

The open question are:
- Can the verifier detect/deduce XDP feature in use, for us?
- How does drivers express/expose XDP features?
- Are features more than XDP return codes, like meta-data support?
- How does this interact with generic-XDP?
- How to expose this to userspace? (to answer does NIC support XDP)
- How to handle tail-call map inserts?
#+end_quote

*** NEXT Propose a driver API to communicate feature flags

- Daniel: Needs to go through driver BPF ndo

Needs to be an API that queries support. We cannot validate on program load
time because of tail call. Not even with cooperation from the tail-calling
program, because that may not know what features are used by the programs it
is tail-calling into.

**** Notes: implementation plan
- On load: verifier populates bpf_prog->feature_bits
- On load, if ifindex: reject if prog->features ^ iface->features
- On attach: reject if prog->features ^ iface->features
- Tail call maps:
  - On insert: if (map->feature_lock) {reject_if(prog->features ^ map->feature_lock)}
                                  else Map->features |= prog->features
  - On prog load, if ifindex: reject if map->features ^ ifindex->features, else
                              progs->maps[]->feature_lock = ifindex->features
                              progs->features |= ifindex->features

*** TODO Add a userspace API to query features

Netlink? Ethtool?

** TODO Multiple XDP programs on a single interface

Being able to load multiple programs on the same XDP interface is an
important use case if XDP is to see more widespread deployment (as otherwise
applications will step on each others' toes when trying to accelerate using
XDP).

The upstream solution for this is known as "dynamic re-linking", which
allows BPF global functions to be replaced by other programs. The last piece
of the kernel functionality for this was posted upstream on January 18th:
https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20200118000657.2135859-1-ast@kernel.org/T/#t

*** TODO Build an XDP chain loader on top of the kernel support

This will be included in [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools]] in both
library and binary form, to hopefully be widely applicable.

* Important medium-term tasks                                       :@medium:

These are tasks that are important to fix in the medium term, but that are
not immediate blockers for functionality. This includes things like
expanding driver support, and adding new features that improve things, but
which are not essential for the basic usefulness of XDP.

Tasks in this category should at a minimum have a fleshed-out problem
description.

** TODO Usability of programs in samples/bpf

unfriendly. #1 they use raw ifindex'es as input + output. #2 the pkt/s

*** TODO Change XDP-samples to enforce native-XDP and report if not avail

The default behaviour when attaching an XDP program on a driver that doesn't
have native-XDP is to fallback to generic-XDP, without notifying the user of
the end-state.

This behaviour is also used by xdp-samples, which unfortunately have lead
end-users to falsely think a given driver supports native-XDP. (QA are using
these xdp-samples and create cases due to this confusion).

Proposal is to change xdp-samples to enforce native-XDP, and report if this
was not possible, together with help text that display cmdline option for
enabling generic-XDP/SKB-mode.

*** TODO Add xdpsock option to allow XDP_PASS for AF_XDP zero-copy mode

In AF_XDP zero-copy mode, sending frame to the network stack via XDP_PASS
results in an expense code path, e.g new page_alloc for copy of payload and
SKB alloc. We need this test how slow this code path is.

Also consider testing XDP-level redirect out another net_device with
AF_XDP-ZC enabled. (I think this will just drop the packets due to
mem_type).

*** TODO xdp_monitor: record and show errno

It would be a big help diagnosing XDP issues if the xdp_monitor program also
reported the errno.

*** TODO xdp_monitor: convert to use raw-tracepoints

The raw-tracepoints are suppose to be much faster, and XDP monitor want to
have as little impact on the system as possible. Thus, convert to use
raw-tracepoints.

** TODO BPF-selftests - top-level TODOs

The kernel git-tree contains a lot of selftests for BPF located in:
=tools/testing/selftests/bpf/=.

XDP (and its performance gain) is tied closely to NIC driver code, which
makes it hard to implement selftests for (including benchmark selftests).
Still we should have a goal of doing functional testing of the XDP core-code
components (via selftests).

Since driver =veth= got native-XDP support, we have an opportunity for
writing selftests that cover both generic-XDP and native-XDP.

*** NEXT bpf-selftest: improve XDP VLAN selftests
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-08-02 Fri 14:02]
:END:

*Assignment* is to improve the selftest shell-script to test both
generic-XDP and native-XDP (for veth driver).

In-progress:
- [[https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/?series=122796&state=%2a][Patchset V1]]

XDP add/remove VLAN headers have a selftest in =tools/testing/selftests/bpf/=
in files =test_xdp_vlan.c= and =test_xdp_vlan.sh=. This test was developed
in conjunction with fixing a bug in generic-XDP (see kernel commit
[[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/297249569932][297249569932]] ("net: fix generic XDP to handle if eth header was mangled")).

Since driver =veth= got native-XDP support, the selftest no-longer tests
generic-XDP code path.

The ip utility (from iproute2) already support specifying, that an XDP prog
must use generic XDP when loading an XDP prog (option =xdpgeneric=).

*** TODO bpf-selftest: find XDP-selftests affected by veth native-XDP

When driver =veth= got native-XDP support, then the XDP-selftests that were
based on =veth= changed from testing generic-XDP into testing native-XDP.

*Assignments:*
1. Determine how many and which veth based XDP-selftests are affected
2. Convert these selftests to test both generic-XDP and native-XDP

*** TODO Make more XDP tests using BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN

[[https://twitter.com/bjorntopel/status/1098563282884014080?s=03][Tweet]] by Björn Töpel (@bjorntopel):

Many people aren't aware of the BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN command. It's really neat
being able to test your XDP programs "offline". The selftests use this a
lot. Docs: https://t.co/GDd7SfNYng and examples in tools/testing/selftests/bpf/.

*** NEXT Could this be a "introduction job"?

** TODO Busy-poll support for AF_XDP

Adding BUSY_POLL support to AF_XDP sockets was presented at the Linux
Plumbers Conference 2018 in Vancouver, BC. With this feature, the NAPI
context of the driver is executed from the process context by the
application calling the poll() syscall, instead of being driven by the
softirq mechanism. This has a number of benefits, for example,
being able to efficiently use a single core for application, driver
and other kernel infra that the application might need. With softirq,
we would need two cores to maintain any performance. Another benefit
is that the cachelines containing the descriptors do not have to
bounce between two caches, since this is now a core local operation as
the driver and the application is on the same core. The drawback is
that we now have to use a syscall (poll) in the data path and this
will slow things down.

There is already a busy_poll mechanisms in the kernel:
/proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll. When writing a non zero value in this
file, the busy poll support will be enabled for ALL sockets in the
system. There are a number of issues with this existing code when
applied to AF_XDP sockets.

 - The batch size is hardcoded to 8, a value that is too small for the
fast processing of XDP.

 - The semantics of poll() in busy_poll mode is that if you provide more
than one file descriptor, it will drive the napi context of the first
one supplied and if it has a packet, then it will NOT drive any of the
other. In other words, it will quit once it has found an fd with a
packet. This will not work for us, since we need all fd's napis to be
called since it is very likely that a packet will be found in each of
them. One could argue that this can be solved in user-space by
manipulating the array of fds supplied to poll() before every singel
call, but this would really complicate multi socket handling in
user-space.

 - The option is global across all sockets. Enough said.

My suggestion for addressing these issues is to introduce a new
busy_poll option that is only for AF_XDP called
XDP_BUSY_POLL_BATCH_SIZE (or something like it). This is a setsockopt
that can be supplied to individual AF_XDP sockets and the batch size
can thus also be set individually by suppling a value > 0. The
semantics of this mode is that both Rx and Tx have to be driven by
calling poll(). There is no guarantee that your packets will arrive or
be sent unless you call poll() (a sendto() will still work for the Tx
case, though, but it is not necessary). In this first patch set, we
can still get interrupts and processing from NAPI in this mode, but we
have some ideas on how to disable this so that NAPI is only driven
from poll(). But that is for a later patch set. Note that the sematics
would not change when we introduce this as we already today say that
you must call poll(), since there is no guarantee otherwise that you
will receive or send packets.

When suppling multiple busy_poll AF_XDP sockets to poll() all of them
will get theire napi contexts executed, so it is guaranteed that all of
them will be driven. It is also possible to mix regular sockets,
global busy_poll sockets and the new AF_XDP sockets in the same poll()
call. The semantics for each type will be maintained, as expected.

From an implementation point of view, I believe this can be
implemented with minimal changes to the net and fs code. We can get
this new behavior by using the standar fd (non-busy poll path) and
then drive the napi from the xsk specific poll callback. We do need to
change one internal interface in order to be able to have a variable
batch size. And Jesper's xdp_rxq_info struct need to be enlarged with a
napi_id field that the drivers need to populate. This can then be used
by the xsk poll code to drive the correct NAPI.

** TODO Exposing more kernel data structures through helpers

One of the strengths of XDP over kernel bypass solutions is the ability to
re-use existing in-kernel data structures, such as the routing table. This
happens through kernel helpers. We already have routing, but we will need
more helpers.

*** NEXT Layer-2 bridging helper
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2e026d1b-d1a1-4fd4-8097-08991cbb8fec
:END:

The obvious next step is a l2 bridging helper that mirrors the l3 routing
one. Should be fairly straight forward to implement.

**** TODO What to do about broadcast/multicast?

See [[id:7e5439f6-7603-4df6-8164-7d2bc5dcd8c3][Handling multicast]] below.

*** TODO Connection/flow tracking

Exposing either full conntrack, or the more light-weight flow tracking
support would make things like stateful firewalls easier to implement.
Probably need a concrete use case for this first, though.

** TODO Port iproute2 to libbpf

The iproute2 XDP loader does not use libbpf, because its implementation
predates the introduction of libbpf as the "official" upstream-blessed
library. This means that there are compatibility issues between the way
iproute2 handles maps, and the way libbpf-based loaders do.

The easiest way to fix this is probably just to port iproute2 to use libbpf.

** TODO Metadata available to programs

The metadata available to XDP programs through the XDP context object could
be expanded with other useful entries. This section collects lists of which
items would be useful to have, and explains why for each of them.

*** TODO XDP frame length
The length of the XDP *frame* (as opposed to the data packet) is needed for
various things:

- Tail-extend (e.g., DNS); currently packets can only be shrunk at the tail
- Correctly reporting skb true-size when generated from XDP frame
- For moving skb allocation out of drivers (long-term)

*** TODO Metadata from hardware
There are various hardware metadata items that would be useful for XDP
programs to access, to reduce the amount of processing that needs to happen
in eBPF. These include:

- Checksum
- Hash value
- Flow designator
- Higher-level protocol header offsets
- Timestamps

**** TODO Needs BTF-based metadata
To express this in a vendor-neutral way, we probably need to depend on the
[[id:25240998-2037-4ebf-befe-c0d0fdacb9c7][BTF-based metadata for XDP]]

** TODO Improvements to XDP_REDIRECT

*** TODO Handling multicast

We want to be able to REDIRECT a packet to multiple interfaces in order to
implement multicast. Relevant for the [[id:2e026d1b-d1a1-4fd4-8097-08991cbb8fec][Layer-2 bridging helper]].

From the discussion at netconf2019 ([[id:92b4926b-cce4-4199-bf99-efc1e4c342be][see slides]]), we probably want to
implement it by:

- Using a map-in-map (or map flag) to designate a group of egress interfaces
  (put multiple ifaces into a map and send to all of them in one operation).

- Just copy the packet rather than try to do clever refcnt stuff for
  multi-xmit.

As a first pass, we probably want to implement a simple multi-xmit, and
leave off the possibility for the eBPF program to modify the packet between
destinations.

*** TODO Queueing and QoS

[[id:6581cd98-c2f8-4244-a4db-b0a5922647c2][See slide for discussion at netconf2019]].

There is currently no queueing in XDP_REDIRECT, apart from the bulking queue
used in the devmaps. This means that rate transitions can't be handled
properly (e.g., redirect 100Gbps->10Gbps).

To fix this, we would need to allow queueing of some sort. Options:

- Allow user to define a queueing structure as part of the TXQ setup
- Create the low-level hooks necessary for eBPF-programmable queueing
- Have some kind of "intermediate queueing structure" that can be a redirect
  target, does queueing, and can forward packets on afterwards

*** TODO Handling XDP_REDIRECT failures
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       760b03fc-2a8e-499c-a90c-74dbc4716cbc
:END:

Presently, an XDP program cannot know if a call to bpf_redirect_map() is
going to fail. This means that programs end up doing things like using
duplicate maps for checking if a redirect map entry exists, or to packets
being silently dropped.

If we simply make the redirect_map() helper check that something exists in
that position in the map, we at least catch the case where a map entry is
empty (where we *know* it is going to fail). If we then later add the
capability for a map to ensure that TX resources are available on insert, we
will get this check for free.

What is the right return code for the helper on failure? We already return
XDP_ABORTED on invalid flags, so we could create a new
REDIRECT_PASS_ON_INVALID that make non-existent map entries return XDP_PASS.
This makes it easy to implement "defer to stack on error" type programs,
*and* it makes it possible to disambiguate between "flag not understood" and
"flag understood and map is empty".

Mellanox drivers turn a failure in xdp_do_redirect() into an ABORTED action,
other drivers do not.

and also the fallback return codes if map index were unpopulated.  BUT the
samples/bpf programs does not take advantage of this. Task is to update
samples/bpf to demonstrate these new features.

**** CANCELLED Retire bpf_redirect() helper                    :CANCELLED:

- State "CANCELLED"  from "NEXT"       [2020-01-16 Thu 15:49] \\
  We've finally fixed the bpf_redirect() helper to no longer have a performance
  delta with the _map variant! :)
:END:

Rather than extending the bpf_redirect() helper to use hidden maps, it is
probably better to document it as deprecated and point users to use the
bpf_redirect_map() helper.

**** TODO What happens if redirect fails even though TX resources are available?

Even with the above, we can still get failures if, e.g., TX ring runs out of
space. We can't really handle this by return, so what should we do instead?
Maybe just defer this to [[id:24faae01-542b-4882-9f7a-5ab283e657b0][XDP hook at TX]].

** TODO Multi-buffer XDP (aka. jumbo-frames)

As described in the design document
[[file:areas/core/xdp-multi-buffer01-design.org]] we need to come up with a
serious attempt at supporting multi-buffer XDP handling. The term
multi-buffer covers the uses cases: jumbo-frames, TSO/LRO, packet header
split.

Add TODO steps here to move this forward.

As long as we don't arrive at a design that cannot be extended with
those features later.

*** TODO Find driver developers that will participate in multi-buffer work

We need some developers that have an actual use-case for this multi-buffer
feature, and also buy-in from some driver team, else this sub-project will
not see any progress.  The Amazon guys seems to have a interest.


* Longer-term preliminary plans                                       :@long:

These are longer-term plans or ideas that either fall into the "nice to
have" category, or which are blocked on other pieces of kernel development;
as well as ideas for things we may include in the future but which is not a
high priority at the moment.

Tasks in this category do not require any particular level of description;
so some of them may simply have a sentence or two describing them.

** TODO Adding AF_XDP support to relevant userspace programs

There are several high-profile userspace programs that might benefit from
AF_XDP support. Adding this (or coordinating it with the program authors)
could be a way to show the benefits of XDP.

[2019-01-18 Fri 13:55]
How do we ensure consistently low latency packet processing is possible with
XDP?

This paper: [[https://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/papers/ITC30-Packet-Filtering-eBPF-XDP.pdf][Performance Implications of Packet Filtering with Linux eBPF]]
conclude that turning on the jit *increases* the number of outliers (though
not quite clear if this is actually supported by their data). This should be
investigated.

Maybe write a tuning doc as well?

WAIT status as this is low priority for now.

From [[https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/92/attachments/91/103/lpc18-xdp-future.pdf][the LPC 2018 paper]]:

#+begin_quote
A limitation of the current design of XDP is that programs get no feedback
if a redirect to another device fails. Instead, the packet is just silently
dropped, and the only way to see why is by attaching to the right
tracepoint. This is especially problematic when forwarding packets from a
fast device to a slower one. And the way =XDP_REDIRECT= is implemented,
there is no way for the XDP program to gain insight into the state of the
device being forwarded /to/.

We believe that a possible fix for this is to add another eBPF hook at
packet egress from a device, i.e., at the latest possible time before a
packet is put into the device TX ring. At this point, it is possible for the
driver to supply information about the current state of the TX ring buffer
(such as free space), which the eBPF program can react appropriately to, for
example by signaling ingress XDP programs to send traffic another way if the
TX ring is full, or by implementing AQM-like reactions when TX ring pressure
increases.

A crazy idea is to allow this egress eBPF hook to perform a new XDP action if it
sees the TX ring is full, such as redirecting the frame out another interface.
Allowing the full XDP feature set of modifying and truncating packet length
would also make is possible to implement a signaling protocol like that
described in [[http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3098822.3098825]].
