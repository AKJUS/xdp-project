Introduce BTF
 - Why we believe BTF can resolve layout problem

Explaining tech quirks for XDP metadata
 - Grows "backwards" from where packets starts
 - Must be 4 byte aligned
 - Limited size (currently) 32 bytes

BTF from kernel modules
 - Add in commit 36e68442d1af ("bpf: Load and verify kernel module BTFs")
   - (Author: Andrii Nakryiko)
   -  https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/36e68442d1af
   - $ git describe --contains  36e68442d1afd
     - v5.11-rc1~169^2~259^2~11^2~1

Challenges with BTF from kernel modules
 - BTF IDs are no-longer unique, but per module

Three types of BTF IDs
 - Kernel BTF IDs (unique for running kernel)
 - Kernel module BTF IDs (offset start at highest kernel id)
 - BPF-prog "local" BTF IDs


Users/consumers of BTF layout
 - BPF-progs (either XDP or TC hooks)
 - XDP to SKB steps (in veth and cpumap) for traditional HW offloads
   - e.g. RX-hash, RX-checksum, VLAN, RX-timestamp
 - Chained BPF-progs can update/communicate state via metadata
 - AF_XDP can consume BTF info in userspace to decode metadata area

Works today:
 - Let XDP BPF-prog determine BTF-layout as local-BPF
   - e.g. produce software RX-timestamp at XDP layer
 - Have AF_XDP program lookup BTF-layout in BPF-object file (setup time)
   - Runtime use matching on local BTF-ID and decode information
 - Idea: store bpf_id as last member in metadata
    - Easily access via negative (-4 bytes) offset from pkt start


Point out code that runtime fill BTF-ID
 - How can BPF-prog assign own static runtime created BTF-ID?
   - libbpf hides resolving these IDs at BPF-load time

#+begin_src C
__u32 btf_id = bpf_core_type_id_local(struct xdp_hints_rx_time);
#+end_src


Inspirational: BTF based XDP-hints
 - Bringing the flexibility of BPF
   to NIC hardware offload

 - Unlocking hardware vendors ability to innovate
   - End-users can consume new HW capabilities
     without having to extend the kernel SKB data-structure

From: https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf
#+begin_quote
BPF is a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed programs in the Linux
kernel without changing kernel source code or loading a kernel module
#+end_quote

/BPF/ is a *technology name*: */no longer an acronym/*

*Rate of innovation* at the operating system level: */Traditionally slow/*
 - BPF enables things at OS-level that were not possible before
 - BPF will /radically increase/ rate of innovation

* Slide: */Reminder/* What is XDP?                                   :export:

XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a Linux *in-kernel* fast-path
 - /Programmable layer in-front/ of traditional network stack
   - Read, modify, drop, redirect or pass
   - For L2-L3 use-cases: seeing /x10 performance/ improvements!
 - *Avoiding* /memory allocations/
   - No SKB allocations and no-init (SKB zeroes 4 cache-lines per pkt)
 - Adaptive *bulk* processing of frames
 - Very /early access/ to frame (in driver code *after DMA sync*)
 - Ability to */skip/ (large parts) of kernel /code/*
   - Evolve XDP via /BPF-helpers/
 - */Pitfall/*: Lost traditional HW offloads (e.g. RX-hash, checksum etc.)

* Slide: What are *traditional* hardware offload hints?              :export:

NIC *hardware* provide offload hints in RX (and TX) *descriptors*
 - */Netstack have extended SKB/* packet data-struct to store+use these

*RX descriptors* can e.g. provide:
 - RX-/checksum/ validation, RX-/hash/ value, RX-/timestamp/
 - RX-/VLAN/ provides VLAN ID/tag non-inline

*TX descriptors* can e.g. ask hardware to perform actions:
 - *TX*-/checksum/: Ask hardware to compute checksums on transmission
 - TX-/VLAN/: Ask hardware in insert VLAN id
 - Advanced: /TX-timestamp/ HW store TX-time and on completion read-back
 - Advanced: /TX-LaunchTime/ ask HW to send packet at specific time in future

* Slide: What are XDP-hints                                          :export:

/XDP-hints/ dates back to NetDevConf [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD1_oAHpUmU][Nov 2017]] (by [[https://legacy.netdevconf.info/2.2/papers/waskiewicz-xdpacceleration-talk.pdf][PJ Waskiewicz]])
 - Purpose: /Let XDP access HW offload hints/

Basic idea:
 - Provide or extract (from descriptor) NIC hardware offload hints
 - *Store info in XDP metadata area* (located before pkt header)

XDP /metadata area/ avail since [[https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg456525.html][Sep 2017]] (by Daniel Borkmann)
 - *Space is limited* (currently 32 bytes)

Main reason XDP-hints work *stalled*
 - */No consensus/* on *layout* of XDP metadata
 - /BTF/ was *not ready* at that time

* Slide: XDP-hints layout defined via /BTF layout/                   :export:
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_extra_attr: class="mid-slide"
:END:

My *proposal*: /Use BTF to define the layout of XDP metadata/
 - Each NIC driver can choose its own BTF layout
 - Slightly *challenging requirement*:
   - NIC driver can change layout per pkt basis (e.g timestamps PTP pkts)

Open question: /Will BTF be a fit for this use-case?/

Next slides: Explaining *BTF technical details*

* Slide: Introducing BTF - BPF Type Format                           :export:

[[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html][BTF]] compact Type Format (based on compilers DWARF debug type info)
 - Great [[https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2018/11/14/btf-enhancement.html][blogpost]] by Andrii Nakryiko
   - 124MB of DWARF data compressed to 1.5MB compact BTF type data
 - Suitable to be /included in Linux kernel image/ by default
   - See file =/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux= avail in most distro kernels
 - Kernel's runtime data structures have become *self-describing via BTF*

#+begin_src sh
 # bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c
#+end_src

** Slide: More components: CO-RE + BTF + libbpf                     :export:

[[https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-portability-and-co-re/#compiler-support][Blogpost]] on BPF *CO-RE* (/Compile Once â€“ Run Everywhere/) (Andrii Nakryiko)
 - Explains how BTF is one piece of the puzzle
 - BPF ELF object files are made /portable across kernel versions via CO-RE/
 - LLVM *compiler emit BTF relocations* (for BPF code accessing struct fields)

BPF-prog (binary ELF object) /loader/ *libbpf* /combines pieces/
 - Tailor BPF-prog code to a particular running kernel
 - Looks at *BPF-prog recorded BTF* type and relocation information
   - /matches/ them to BTF information provided by *running kernel*
   - /updates necessary offsets/ and other relocatable data
 - Kernel struct can change layout, iff member name+size stays same

** Slide: [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/blob/master/ktrace-CO-RE/ktrace01_kern.c][Code-Example]]: Partial struct + runtime BTF-id             :export:

BPF-prog can define /partial struct/ with few members
 - libbpf match + "removes" *triple-underscore* after /real struct name/
 - *preserve_access_index* will be matched against kernel data-structure

#+begin_src C
struct sk_buff___local {
	__u32 hash;
} __attribute__((preserve_access_index));

SEC("kprobe/udp_send_skb.isra.0")
int BPF_KPROBE(udp_send_skb, struct sk_buff___local *skb)
{
	__u32 h; __u32 btf_id;
	BPF_CORE_READ_INTO(&h, skb, hash); /* skb->hash */
	btf_id = bpf_core_type_id_kernel(struct sk_buff___local);
	bpf_printk("skb->hash=0x%x btf_id(skb)=%d", h, btf_id);
}
#+end_src

Notice: Can get *btf_id* for /sk_buff/ used by *running* /kernel/

** Slide: BTF type IDs and their usage                              :export:

BTF system have *type ID's* to refer to each-other (in compress format)
 - Zero is not a valid BTF ID and numbering (usually) *starts from one*
   - Userspace can dump and see numbering via /=bpftool btf dump file=/

/Kernel's BTF/ data files are located in *=/sys/kernel/btf/=* (modules since [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/36e68442d1af][v5.11]])
 - Main file *vmlinux* contains every type /compiled into kernel/
 - All *module files* offset ID numbering to start at *last* /vmlinux/ *ID*
   - Allows module to reference vmlinux type IDs (for compression)

/Userspace/ BPF-prog ELF-object files also contains *BTF sections*
 - This is known as /local/ BTF and numbering starts at one
 - BPF-prog can query own local BTF id via: *=bpf_core_type_id_local()=*

* Slide: Back to XDP-hints                                           :export:
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_extra_attr: class="mid-slide"
:END:

Back to /XDP-hints/ and /XDP/ *metadata* /area/

** Slide: XDP metadata requirements                                 :export:

XDP metadata area have some *properties*
 - *Grows "backwards"* from where packets starts
 - Must be 4 byte aligned
 - Limited size (currently) 32 bytes

BPF-prog can expand/grow area via helper: /=bpf_xdp_adjust_meta=/
 - pkt-data pointers are invalidated after calling this
 - /Verifier/ require *boundary checks* to access metadata area

Common gotcha: Compiler likes to pad C-struct ending
 - Avoid/fix via: *=__attribute__((packed))=*

** Slide: Expected *users* of the XDP-hints                         :export:

/Users/consumers/ of XDP-hints in *BTF layout*
 - *BPF-progs* first obvious consumer (either XDP or TC hooks)
 - *XDP to SKB* conversion (in veth and cpumap) for traditional HW offloads
   - e.g. RX-hash, RX-checksum, VLAN, RX-timestamp
   - Have potential to /simplify NIC drivers significantly/
 - *Chained* /BPF-progs/ can *communicate state* via metadata
 - *AF_XDP* can consume /BTF/ info in userspace to /decode metadata area/

* Slide: XDP-hints exploring solutions using BTF                     :export:
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_extra_attr: class="mid-slide"
:END:

*Design not fully done* yet
 - Upstream interaction will likely change solution anyhow

Next slides: *Proposed* /solutions/ with pros and cons

** Slide: Solution(A): Kernel internal focused                      :export:

Kernel-side: Could *extend* /=xdp_buff=/ + /=xdp_frame=/ with "btf_id" or ptr
 - /Pros/: Gives BPF-prog access to reading /=ctx->btf_id=/
   - */Cons/*: /AF_XDP/ *cannot read* this ctx->btf_id
   - *Unknown*: Can /chained BPF-progs/ *update/write* ctx->btf_id *?*
 - /Pros/: /Kernel internally/ can (likely) store *pointer to btf* struct
   - */Cons/*: This needs reference counting and race/lifetime handling
 - /Pros/: *XDP to SKB* conversion (should be) easier to extract offloads
   - *Unknown*: Will it be harder to support change /layout per pkt/ *???*

Details: If */dropping/* /layout per pkt/ requirement
 - Possible to /store btf pointer in/ *=xdp_rxq_info=*

** Slide: Solution(B): /Decouple/ with *btf_id* /in metadata/       :export:

Place *"btf_id" value* /inside metadata/ area, *as last member*
 - last member: due to "grows" backwards, important for AF_XDP decoding
 - Extend /=xdp_buff=/ + /=xdp_frame=/ (+AF_XDP) with flags that BTF is "enabled"
   - */Notice/*: Need *3 flags* for BTF "origin" (vmlinux, module or local)

This cause /decoupling via btf_id/ as becomes *struct "version"* number
 - /Pros/: Easy to handle change /layout per pkt/
   - as BPF-prog (or AF_XDP) /multiplex on btf_id's/ known to "them"
 - */Cons/*: *XDP to SKB* conversion */harder/* as kernel cannot trust btf_id
   - /Solution/: Add new /BPF-hook/ at *XDP to SKB* point (BPF-prog update skb)

** Slide: Solution(C): Combined proposal                            :export:

Still place *"btf_id" value* /inside metadata/ area, *as last member*
 - *BUT* is considered /cached version/ from *kernel stored pointer to btf*
   - */Cons/*: reference counting and lifetime handling still needed

/Pros/: *XDP to SKB* conversion /can work/
 - via check if btf_id match btf-ptr id before trusting BTF layout
 - Details: For "lifetime" module BTF driver could disable this step on teardown

/Pros/: *Chained* /BPF-progs/ works
 - (last_member) /btf_id/ becomes a /communication channel/
   - *Unknown*: How to communicate BTF "origin" (vmlinux, module or local)?

* Slide: Hardware considerations                                     :export:

Goal: hardware should produce XDP-hints

Consider defining Endianess: Big vs Little endian
 - In XDP-hints struct layout



* Idea

Idea let NIC define an encapsulating union "xdp_hints" with structs

#+begin_src C
union xdp_hints {
  struct hint_generic {
    u32 rx_hash32;
    u32 flags;
    u32 btf_id;
  };

  struct hint_timestamps {
    u64 rx_timestamp;
    u32 btf_id;
  };
};

#+end_src
