* Description from Netdevconf 0x19

Netdev 0x19, like all the previous netdev conferences, is a conference of the
netdev community, by the netdev community, for the netdev community. Linux
kernel networking and user space utilization of the interfaces to the Linux
kernel networking subsystem are the focus. If you are using Linux as a boot
system for proprietary networking, then this conference _may not be for you_.
