\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present and evaluate a scalable, lock-less synchronization mechanism which allows for the correct enforcement of a global rate limit when scaling to multiple hardware queues.
We integrated this synchronization mechanism into the CAKE queueing discipline, thus enabling running CAKE in combination with the MQ qdisc.
We showed that \textit{mq-cake} overcomes the scaling limitations of HTB and CAKE, while achieving an accuracy deviation of less than 0.25\% across a variety of rate limits up to 25 Gbps.
Further, \textit{mq-cake} reduces tail latencies up to 2500x as compared to EDT-BPF.
We believe that the proposed synchronization mechanism is a promising approach to effectively share state across queueing disciplines.
