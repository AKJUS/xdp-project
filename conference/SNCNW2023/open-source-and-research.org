* For conference: SNCNW 2023                                       :noexport:

This presentation is for the SNCNW conference in June 2023:
http://www.sncnw.se/2023/program.html

* Outline / ideas                                                  :noexport:
Message: researchers and open source community should cooperate more


** Motivation, commons

Why are you here?

Get participants to talk about their motivation (for research, work), steer
towards contributing, building etc

*** Tragedy of the commons

Wasn't actually a thing, historically

What is a commons - digital commons.

Contributing to the body of human knowledge.

*** Openness

Benefits of openness:
- Reproducibility
- Diversity of ideas (by public comments)
- Derivative works - more innovation
- Efficiency - no reinventing of the wheel
- Honesty, accountability (have to argue on the merits)

** Research and software

Similarities between research and open source, the ideal:
- Openly available for anyone to use
- Peer review
- Anyone can participate
- Results disseminated into society

Similarities - failure modes:
- Need to be part of close-knit community
- Lack of funding
- Unused
- Not reproducible / not really open

What can research gain from FOSS:
- Software widely used / results disseminated
- Code quality
- Review and feedback from experts outside research community

What can FOSS gain from research community:
- New and original ideas, exploratory work
- Sound theoretical foundations
- Funding (manpower)

** Examples

WiFi
pping

** How to contribute

- Identify relevant projects
- Engage early

** Similarities (ideal)

- Openly available for anyone to use
- Peer review
- Anyone can participate
- Results disseminated into society

** Failure modes

- Hard to become part of community
- Funding woes
- Obscurity
- Not reproducible / not really open

** Benefits for researchers

- Feedback from experts outside research community
- Software widely used / results disseminated
- Code quality, production focus (varies)

** Benefits for open source community

- New and original ideas, exploratory work
- Sound theoretical foundations
- More contributors

* Tips for working with the open source community                    :export:

- Clearly explain context: goals, assumptions, limitations
- Engage early and be ready to make adjustments
- Remember, it's just code!
