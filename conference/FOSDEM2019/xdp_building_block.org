* Export/generate presentation

This presentation is written in org-mode and exported to reveal.js HTML format.
The org-mode :export: tag determines what headlines/section are turned into
slides for the presentation.

** Setup for org-mode export to reveal.js
First, install the ox-reveal emacs package.

Package: ox-reveal git-repo and install instructions:
https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal

** Export to HTML reveal.js

After installing ox-reveal emacs package, export to HTML reveal.js format via
keyboard shortcut: =C-c C-e R R=

The variables at document end ("Local Variables") will set up the title slide
and filter the "Slide:" prefix from headings; Emacs will ask for permission to
load them, as they will execute code.

** Export to PDF

The presentations can be converted to PDF format.  Usually the reveal.js when
run as a webserver under nodejs, have a printer option for exporting to PDF via
print to file, but we choose not run this builtin webserver.

Alternatively we found a tool called 'decktape', for exporting HTML pages to
PDF: https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape

The 'npm install' command:

 $ npm install decktape

After this the =decktape= command should be avail. If the npm install failed,
then it's possible to run the decktape.js file direct from the git-repo via the
=node= command:

#+begin_src bash
$ node ~/git/decktape/decktape.js \
    -s 1600x900 -p 100 --chrome-arg=--no-sandbox \
     xdp_building_block.html \
     xdp_building_block.pdf
#+end_src

The size is set to get slide text to fit on the page. And -p 100 makes it go
faster.


* Slides below                                                     :noexport:

Only sections with tag ":export:" will end-up in the presentation.

Colors are choosen via org-mode italic/bold high-lighting:
 - /italic/ = /green/
 - *bold*   = *yellow*
 - */italic-bold/* = red

* Slide: Framing XDP                                                 :export:

XDP: new /in-kernel programmable/ (eBPF) *layer before netstack*
 - Similar speeds as DPDK
XDP ensure that *Linux networking stays relevant*
 - Operate at L2-L3, netstack operate L4-L7
XDP is not first mover, but believe XDP is /different and better/
 - /Killer feature/: Integration with Linux kernel
 - Flexible sharing of NIC resources
