#+TITLE: Notes for XDP Hands-On Tutorial
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* git repo for tutorial

** Creation of git-repo

Create GitHub repo:
 https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial

Add libbpf as git submodule

Command used:
#+begin_example
git submodule add https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/ libbpf
#+end_example

* Tutorial contents via directory layout

Idea: The directory layout in git-repo is part of the tutorial.

Each directory contains an assignment.

** basic01: simple XDP_PASS program

Alternative dirnames:
- basic01-xdp-pass
- basic01-begin-here

Instructors purpose:
- Make sure this compiles on participants laptop/setup
- Introduction to libbpf

Instructor uncertainly:
- This very simple XDP_PASS prog could be loaded with the iproute2 'ip'
  command.  Should we also introduce this possibility?
- Inspection of loaded XDP programs can also

What participant will learn:
- See first basic XDP program.
- Understand split between kernel and userspace side.
- Load XDP program on an interface.
- Learn to use bpftool to inspect what is running.
- Also learn that iproute2 'ip link show' shows XDP info

** basic02: implement counter via BPF-map

Alternative dirnames:
- basic02-map-counter
- basic02-next-step

Instructors purpose:
- Introduce maps
- Explain what libbpf does behind the scenes
- Explain maps are FD (File Descriptors), but accessed through bpf-syscall

Provided
- XDP pass program that uses a map for counting packets

Assignment
- Convert program to use a PER-CPU maps for counters and avoid an atomic
  operation in fast-path.

What participant will learn:
- Introduction to BPF maps
- learn how to *read* from map from userspace.
- Learn how to interact with PER-CPU maps from userspace

** basicXX: reading xdp_rxq_info

Idea: like sample/bpf/xdp_rxq_info make participants read out stats per RXQ.

Issue: Will this work with =veth= driver???

What participant will learn:
- That info about RXQ in avail to XDP prog

** basicXX: next-topics idea





* Discuss dependency to package kernel-headers

When building XDP-tutorial, there is also a dependency to package
=kernel-headers=.

E.g. All the include <linux/XXX> files. It would be too much work to maintain
that in the repo...
