* For conference: Tech Summit at Fastly                            :noexport:

Request from Fastly engineer Sanjay Rao (know from Netfilter workshop):

They asked me to find out if you could do a virtual talk at our upcoming
"Tech Summit", October 4-6

Title: XDP and BPF insights
 - Programmable Runtime Extending Linux Kernel for Packet Processing

** Abstract:

This talk will give an insights into BPF and XDP (eXpress Data Path)
technologies.

These technologies are changing the traditional Operating System model.

The Linux Kernel is becoming programmable and runtime extendable,
without the risk of crashing the kernel. BPF is a sandbox technology
that provide an alternative to Kernel modules.

These technologies push the limits on what is possible for fast
programmable packet processing in the Operating System Kernel.

Talk will also cover future work and planned extensions to XDP.

* Colors in slides                                                 :noexport:

Text colors on slides are chosen via org-mode italic/bold high-lighting:
 - /italic/ = /green/
 - *bold*   = *yellow*
 - */italic-bold/* = red

* Brainstorm notes                                                 :noexport:

Make them aware of BPF/XDP communities
 - Mention: xdp-newbies@vger.kernel.org

BPF 7-years (and XDP 5 years)
 - Congrats, *but* evolution of BPF features
 - Evolved
 - Resulted in many out-dated Google search articles
 - Old outdated approaches are used as best-practices 

* Slide: Overview: What will you /learn/?                            :export:

First part: Covers *what is BPF?*
 - How this technology fundamentally change the existing OS-model

*/FIXME/*: Add MORE to this slide

* Slide: What is BPF ?                                               :export:

From: https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf
#+begin_quote
eBPF is a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed programs in the Linux
kernel without changing kernel source code or loading a kernel module
#+end_quote

/BPF/ is a *technology name*: */no longer an acronym/*

*Rate of innovation* at the operating system level: */Traditionally slow/*
 - BPF enables things at OS-level that were not possible before
 - BPF will /radically increase/ rate of innovation

** Slide: *Traditional* Kernel development process

** Slide: *BPF* development process

* Slide: What is BPF from OS-vendor perspective                      :export:

From an OS vendor (like Red Hat) perspective
- BPF is a  */fundamental change/* to a 50-year old *kernel model*
  - New interface for applications to make kernel requests, alongside syscalls
- BPF is "/kernel-mode applications/"
- See it as /safer/ alternative to *kernel modules*
  - Better way to extend the kernel dynamically
  - Kernel developers: Do lose some control
  - ... but positive for rate of innovation

** Slide: A new Operating System Model                              :export:

Modern Linux: becoming Microkernel-ish ([[http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-12-02/bpf-a-new-type-of-software.html][from Brendan Gregg]])

** Slide: Adjust mental model of system development                 :export:

As /System Developers/: */Adjust your mental model/*
 - /No need/ to bring everything into *userspace*
 - Can task be solve via /kernel-side/ *inline* processing and manipulation?

Utilize *BPF* /superpowers/
 - Linux Kernel have become a flexible tool at your disposal
 - Run *your own* BPF /kernel-mode application/ inside the kernel

* Slide: BPF components                                            :export:

Closer look at the BPF components:

 - /Bytecode/ - Architecture independent *Instruction Set*
   * /JIT/ to native machine instructions (after loading into kernel)

 - /Runtime environment/ - Linux kernel
   * *Event based* BPF-hooks all over the kernel
   * Per hook limited access to kernel functions via *BPF-helpers*

 - *Sandboxed* by the BPF /Verifier/
   * Limits and verifies memory access and instructions limit

* Slide: BPF functional areas                                        :export:

BPF have hooks ALL over the kernel
 - More interesting: What *functional areas* are these being used?

What (current) areas are BPF being used within?
 - /Networking/ (ahead as BPF started in networking)
   - Network control and data plane implemented in BPF (TC-BPF/XDP)
   - TCP Congestion Control implemented in BPF
 - /Security/
 - /Observability/ (tracing)

* Emacs end-tricks                                                 :noexport:

This section contains some emacs tricks, that e.g. remove the "Slide:" prefix
in the compiled version.
