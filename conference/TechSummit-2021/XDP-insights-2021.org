Title: XDP and BPF insights
 - Programmable Runtime Extending Linux Kernel for Packet Processing

** Abstract:

This talk will give an insights into BPF and XDP (eXpress Data Path)
technologies.

These technologies are changing the traditional Operating System model.

The Linux Kernel is becoming programmable and runtime extendable,
without the risk of crashing the kernel. BPF is a sandbox technology
that provide an alternative to Kernel modules.

These technologies push the limits on what is possible for fast
programmable packet processing in the Operating System Kernel.

Talk will also cover future work and planned extensions to XDP.

* Brainstorm notes                                                 :noexport:

Make them aware of BPF/XDP communities
 - Mention: xdp-newbies@vger.kernel.org

BPF 7-years (and XDP 5 years)
 - Congrats, *but* evolution of BPF features
 - Evolved
 - Resulted in many out-dated Google search articles
 - Old outdated approaches are used as best-practices

* Colors in slides                                                 :noexport:

Text colors on slides are chosen via org-mode italic/bold high-lighting:
 - /italic/ = /green/
 - *bold*   = *yellow*
 - */italic-bold/* = red

* Emacs end-tricks                                                 :noexport:

This section contains some emacs tricks, that e.g. remove the "Slide:" prefix
in the compiled version.
