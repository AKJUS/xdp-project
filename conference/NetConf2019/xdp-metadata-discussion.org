* For conference: NetConf 2019

This presentation will be given at [[http://vger.kernel.org/netconf2019.html][Netconf 2019]].

* Export/generate presentation

This presentation is written in org-mode and exported to reveal.js HTML format.
The org-mode :export: tag determines what headlines/section are turned into
slides for the presentation.

** Setup for org-mode export to reveal.js
First, install the ox-reveal emacs package.

Package: ox-reveal git-repo and install instructions:
https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal

** Export to HTML reveal.js

After installing ox-reveal emacs package, export to HTML reveal.js format via
keyboard shortcut: =C-c C-e R R=

The variables at document end ("Local Variables") will set up the title slide
and filter the "Slide:" prefix from headings; Emacs will ask for permission to
load them, as they will execute code.

** Export to PDF

The presentations can be converted to PDF format.  Usually the reveal.js when
run as a webserver under nodejs, have a printer option for exporting to PDF via
print to file, but we choose not run this builtin webserver.

Alternatively we found a tool called 'decktape', for exporting HTML pages to
PDF: https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape

The 'npm install' command:

 $ npm install decktape

After this the =decktape= command should be avail. If the npm install failed,
then it's possible to run the decktape.js file direct from the git-repo via the
=node= command:

#+begin_src bash
$ node ~/git/decktape/decktape.js \
    -s 1600x900 -p 100 --chrome-arg=--no-sandbox \
     xdp-metadata-discussion.html \
     xdp-metadata-discussion.pdf
#+end_src

The size is set to get slide text to fit on the page. And -p 100 makes it go
faster.


* Slides below                                                     :noexport:

Only sections with tag ":export:" will end-up in the presentation.

* Colors examples                                                  :noexport:
Colors are choosen via org-mode italic/bold high-lighting:
 - /italic/ = /green/
 - *bold*   = *yellow*
 - */italic-bold/* = red

* Better title?

The title and angle might need to change to talk?

Title suggestions:
- XDP metadata discussion for hardware-offloads
- SKB creation outside drivers: using metadata and HW-offloads?

* Slide: Move SKB allocations out of NIC drivers                     :export:

Goal: Simplify driver, via creating SKB inside network-core code
- Happens today via *=xdp_frame=* in both /veth/ and /cpumap/

The =xdp_frame= is placed in top of data-frame (=data_hard_start=)
- Currently 32-bytes

Issue: *SKB*'s created this way are /lacking HW-offloads/ like:
- HW /checksum/ info (for =skb->ip_summed= + =skb->csum=)
- HW /RX hash/ (=skb_set_hash(hash, type)=)
- (these are almost always needed... tempted to extend =xdp_frame=)

** Slide: Other HW-offloads

Other /existing/ offloads, used by SKBs, but *not always enabled*
 - /VLAN/ (=__vlan_hwaccel_put_tag()=)
 - RX /timestamp/
   - HW =skb_hwtstamps()= (stored in skb_shared_info)
   - Earlier XDP software timestamp (for =skb->tstamp=)
 - RX /mark/ (=skb->mark= supported by mlx5)

@@html:<br/><small>@@
Other *potential* offloads, which hardware can do (but not used by SKB):
 - Unique u64 /flow identifier/ key (mlx5 HW)
 - Higher-level protocol header offsets
   - RSS-hash can deduce e.g. IPv4/TCP (as frag not marked as TCP)
   - But NIC HW have full parse info avail

The GOAL is to come-up with a Generic Offload Abstraction Layer...
@@html:</small>@@

Generic and dynamic way to transfer HW-offload info
- Only enable info when needed
- Both /made available for SKB creation and and XDP-prog/

The big questions are:
- Where to *store this information?*
- How to make it /dynamic/?

* Slide: Simple static solution                                      :export:

The simple solution that isn't as dynamic as we want...
@@html:</small>@@

Have drivers send along *extra struct with info* to =xdp_do_redirect()=
- Use info-struct when calling =convert_to_xdp_frame()=

Drivers have to *fill-out* info-struct *every time*
- Driver basically transfer /info from descriptor/ to info-struct
- All drivers have to agree on struct layout

The *XDP-prog don't have access to info-struct*
- As =xdp_do_redirect()= happens after XDP-prog runs
  - (could solve via also giving info-struct to XDP-prog)

** Slide: Use NIC frame descriptor directly? (No)                   :export:

@@html:<small>@@
This came up before... why not give NIC frame descriptor directly to BPF?
@@html:</small>@@

Why can't we use frame descriptor directly?
- Very compact bit format and union overloaded
  - Even if possible to describe via BTF
  - Prog to *decode too specific to vendor* HW (+ revision)
- *HW revisions have erratas* (e.g. ixgbe csum invalid in one HW rev)
  - A driver translation function should handle/hide this
- With cpumap xdp_frame is /read on remote CPU/, descriptor not-valid

* Slide: Where to store the offload info?                            :export:

At least /info-struct/ should be /described via BTF/

Instead of separate info-struct, *store* /info-struct/ *in data-frame area*?
- Two options:
  - Use XDP metadata area (already avail to XDP)
  - Use areas "inside" xdp_frame (or dynamic area after xdp_frame ends)
    - not curr avail to XDP, as xdp_frame is after XDP-prog

Note: Cannot store info-struct inside =xdp_rxq_info=
- Because not a per frame data-structure, and xdp_frame use bulk processing

** Slide: Background: What is XDP-metadata area?                    :export:

@@html:<small>@@
Background slide, what do we have today...
@@html:</small>@@

XDP have 32 bytes *metadata* in front of payload (=xdp_buff->data_meta=)
 - XDP tail-calls can read this (transfer info between tail-calls)
 - TC eBPF (cls_bpf) can read this, and update SKB fields
   - E.g. save XDP lookup and use in TC eBPF hook
 - *AF_XDP* raw frames have this /metadata avail in front of payload/

* Slide: Safe to allow XDP to update offload info?                   :export:

Can we allow XDP to update offload info area?
- Happens before SKB field update
- Are there any safety issues? (kernel netstack stability)
- XDP could potentially fix HW-offload fields

Likely need some boundary checks
- Especially for higher-level protocol header offsets

* Slide: Lacking knowledge about BTF                                 :export:

When info-struct is described via BTF
- Can kernel code understand BTF and act dynamic???
  - In =convert_to_xdp_frame()= code
  - And in xdp_frame to SKB update fields code?

Hack: if driver knows order struct-members can appear in
- Walk BTF format and create bitmap with enabled members
- When member is match, increment iterator with member size
- (Fear this is slow, due to data dependency on iterator)

* Slide: Driver call-back function                                   :export:

Driver fill-out "info-struct", thus knows layout
- xdp_frame to SKB conversion, use driver call-back to update SKB fields?

One step further
- Could driver call-back be a BPF-prog, that update SKB fields?

* Slide: How to configure driver for this?                           :export:
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_extra_attr: class="mid-slide"
:END:

Next challenge: What is the interface for configuring this?
- Extending =ndo_bpf= seems obvious
- But there is a dependency between
  - info-struct, driver populate, and SKB-update call-back
  - And if XDP-prog use BTF-metadata layout, how can it change

* Slide: Driver static approach                                      :export:

Steps for static driver
- /Point#A/: Driver define static info-struct for metadata area
  - Create BTF-format (via macros) and register with BPF (?)
  - Adjust =xdp_buff->data_meta= with info-struct size
- /Point#B/: Driver function *populate metadata with offloads* from descriptor
  - It know about HW offloads curr enabled, revisions and quirks
- *XDP-prog* is called (how do user get BTF-format?)
- /Point#C/: Driver static SKB-update call-back
  - Via XDP-redirect (either cpumap or veth) call-back is invoked with SKB

** Slide: More dynamic approach                                     :export:

Same steps: /Point#A/ + /Point#B/
- /Point#A/: Driver define static info-struct for metadata area
  - Create BTF-format (via macros) and register with BPF
- /Point#B/: Driver function *populate metadata with offloads* from descriptor

Dynamic BPF call-back
- /Point#C/: Driver SKB-update call-back is a BPF-prog
- This SKB-update BPF-prog, must have /map named 'metadata'/
  - map must have *BTF-format that match driver* BTF-format
    - checked on attach via =ndo_bpf=, else reject

* Slide: When to enable populate metadata                            :export:

The populate metadata function is *not default enabled*
- Driver create real BPF-map with BTF-format for metadata (as value)
  - (Key is driver "id" for this map, allow for more maps per driver)
- Add =ndo_bpf= /query for metadata-map/, return map-fd
  - Both XDP-prog and SKB-update prog can use map

Trigger to *enable/disable*, when /map-user gets attached/detached/
- (1) =ndo_bpf= attach SKB-update BPF-prog that use this map,
- and/or when (2) =ndo_bpf= XDP-prog being attached (that use map)
  - Both cases, check BTF-format match or reject attach
- The *map-refcnt*, determine when to /disable/ populate metadata again

** Slide: Selecting metadata layouts                                :export:

/Driver/ can have *multiple metadata-maps*
- Identified via /map-key as id/
- (the map-value define metadata layout via BTF-format)
- Each map (likely) have *different driver populate function* associated


* Slide: End                                                         :export:

* Different approach

XDP-prog create map with special name e.g. "HW-offload"
- Map have BTF description
- Some BTF names have special meaning like:
  - csum, rss-hash
  - BTF-size can be checked by driver/bpf-core
