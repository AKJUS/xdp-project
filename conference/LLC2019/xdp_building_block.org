* For conference: Lund Linux Con 2019

This presentation will be given at [[https://lundlinuxcon.org/][LLC 2019] the
Lund Linux Con.

Titled: XDP As a building block for other FOSS projects

* Export/generate presentation

This presentation is written in org-mode and exported to reveal.js HTML format.
The org-mode :export: tag determines what headlines/section are turned into
slides for the presentation.

** Setup for org-mode export to reveal.js
First, install the ox-reveal emacs package.

Package: ox-reveal git-repo and install instructions:
https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal

** Export to HTML reveal.js

After installing ox-reveal emacs package, export to HTML reveal.js format via
keyboard shortcut: =C-c C-e R R=

The variables at document end ("Local Variables") will set up the title slide
and filter the "Slide:" prefix from headings; Emacs will ask for permission to
load them, as they will execute code.

** Export to PDF

The presentations can be converted to PDF format.  Usually the reveal.js when
run as a webserver under nodejs, have a printer option for exporting to PDF via
print to file, but we choose not run this builtin webserver.

Alternatively we found a tool called 'decktape', for exporting HTML pages to
PDF: https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape

The 'npm install' command:

 $ npm install decktape

After this the =decktape= command should be avail. If the npm install failed,
then it's possible to run the decktape.js file direct from the git-repo via the
=node= command:

#+begin_src bash
$ node ~/git/decktape/decktape.js \
    -s 1600x900 -p 100 --chrome-arg=--no-sandbox \
     xdp_building_block.html \
     xdp_building_block.pdf
#+end_src

The size is set to get slide text to fit on the page. And -p 100 makes it go
faster.

* Slide: Framing XDP                                                 :export:

XDP: new /in-kernel programmable/ (eBPF) *layer before netstack*
 - Similar speeds as DPDK
XDP ensures that *Linux networking stays relevant*
 - Operates at L2-L3, netstack is L4-L7
XDP is not first mover, but we believe XDP is /different and better/
 - /Killer feature/: Integration with Linux kernel
 - Flexible sharing of NIC resources


** Slide: What is XDP?                                              :export:

XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a Linux *in-kernel* fast-path
 - /New programmable layer in-front/ of traditional network stack
 - Already accepted part of upstream kernels (and RHEL8)
 - Operate at the same level and speeds as DPDK
 - For L2-L3 use-cases: seeing x10 performance improvements!
 - Can accelerate *in-kernel* L2-L3 use-cases (e.g. forwarding)

What is /AF_XDP/? (the Address Family XDP socket)
 - Hybrid *kernel-bypass* facility, move selective frames out of kernel
 - XDP/eBPF prog filters packets using REDIRECT into AF_XDP socket
 - Delivers raw L2 frames into userspace

** Slide: Why is XDP needed?                                        :export:

This is about *the Kernel networking stack staying relevant*
 - For emerging use-cases and areas

Linux networking stack optimized for layers L4-L7
 - Missing something to address L2-L3 use-cases

XDP operate at layers L2-L3

** Slide: Existing solutions: Not first mover                       :export:

XDP is not first mover in this area
 - But we believe /XDP is different and better/

Existing *kernel bypass* solutions:
 - netmap (FreeBSD), DPDK (Intel/LF), PF_ring (ntop)
 - maglev (Google), Onload (SolarFlare), Snabb

Commercial solutions /similar to XDP/:
 - ndiv by HAproxy, product [[https://www.haproxy.com/products/aloha-hardware-appliance/][ALOHA]]

** Slide: What makes XDP different and better?                      :export:

*Not bypass*, but /in-kernel fast-path/

The killer feature of XDP is integration with Linux kernel,
 - Leverages /existing kernel drivers/ and infrastructure
 - Programmable flexibility via eBPF sandboxing (kernel infra)
 - Flexible sharing of NIC resources between Linux and XDP
 - Cooperation with netstack via eBPF-helpers and fallback-handling
 - No need to reinject packets (unlike bypass solutions)

/AF_XDP/ for /flexible/ *kernel bypass*
 - Cooperate with use-cases needing fast raw frame access in userspace
 - While leveraging existing kernel NIC drivers

It is fundamental to understand
@@html:</small>@@

/XDP is a component/; a core facility provided by the kernel
 - Put it together with other components to solve a task

eBPF (incl XDP) is *not a product in itself*
 - Existing (and new) Open Source projects will use these eBPF components

/Full potential/ comes when
 - Combining XDP-eBPF with other eBPF-hooks and facilities
 - To construct a *"networking pipeline"* via kernel components
 - The [[https://cilium.io/][Cilium]] project is a good example (container L4-L7 policy)

* Slide: XDP use-cases                                               :export:
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Areas and use-cases where XDP is /already being used/

Touch upon *new potential* and opportunities
- e.g. for Virtual Machines (VM) and Containers

** Use-case: Anti-DDoS                                              :export:

The most obvious use case for XDP is *anti-DDoS*

Companies already deployed XDP in production for anti-DDoS
 - /Facebook/, every packet goes through XDP for [[http://vger.kernel.org/lpc-networking2018.html#session-10][1.5 years]]
 - /CloudFlare/ [[https://blog.cloudflare.com/l4drop-xdp-ebpf-based-ddos-mitigations/][switched to XDP]] (changed NIC vendor due to XDP support!)

*New potential*: Protecting Containers and VMs
 - /Containers/: Protect Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster with XDP
 - /VM/: Host-OS protect Guest-OS'es via XDP
   - Work-in-progress: allow vhost/virtio_net; upload XDP to Host-OS

** Use-case: L4 Load-balancer                                       :export:

/Facebook/ was using the kernel Load-balancer IPVS
 - Switched to using XDP instead: Reported /x10 performance improvement/
 - Open Sourced their [[https://code.fb.com/open-source/open-sourcing-katran-a-scalable-network-load-balancer/][XDP load-balancer]] called [[https://github.com/facebookincubator/katran][katran]]

*New potential*: Host OS load-balancing to VMs and Containers
 - /VM/: Phy-NIC can XDP_REDIRECT into Guest-NIC
   - driver tuntap queues XDP-raw frames to virtio_net; *skip SKB in Host-OS*
 - /Container/: Phy-NIC can XDP_REDIRECT into *veth* (kernel v4.20)
   - driver veth allocs+builds SKB outside driver-code; speedup *skip some code*
   - veth can /RE-redirect/, allow *building interesting proxy-solutions*

XDP can (easily) be misused in the same way as kernel bypass solutions
@@html:</small>@@

Being smart about how XDP is integrated into existing Open Source solutions
 - Leverage existing eco-systems e.g. for control plane setup

** Slide: Evolving XDP via BPF-helpers                               :export:

@@html:<small>@@
*We should encourage adding helpers instead of duplicating data in BPF maps*
@@html:</small>@@

Think of XDP as a /software offload layer for the kernel netstack/
 - Simply setup and use the Linux netstack, but accelerate parts of it with XDP

IP routing good example: /Access routing table from XDP via BPF helpers/ (v4.18)
 - Let Linux handle routing (daemons) and neighbour lookups
 - Talk at LPC-2018 (David Ahern): [[http://vger.kernel.org/lpc-networking2018.html#session-1][Leveraging Kernel Tables with XDP]]

Obvious *next target*: /Bridge lookup helper/
 - Like IP routing: transparent XDP acceleration of bridge forwarding
   - Fallback for ARP lookups, flooding etc.
 - Huge potential *performance boost for Linux bridge* use cases!


** Slide: Transfer info between XDP and netstack                     :export:

Ways to transfer /info between XDP and netstack/
 - XDP can *modify packet headers* before netstack
   - Pop/push headers influence RX-handler in netstack
   - CloudFlare modifies MAC-src on sampled dropped packets
 - XDP have 32 bytes *metadata* in front of payload
   - TC eBPF (cls_bpf) can read this, and update SKB fields
   - E.g. save XDP lookup and use in TC eBPF hook
   - *AF_XDP* raw frames have this /metadata avail in front of payload/

* Slide: XDP integration with OVS                                    :export:

XDP/eBPF can integrate/offload Open vSwitch (OVS) in many ways
 - VMware (William Tu) presented different options at LPC 2018:
   - [[http://vger.kernel.org/lpc-networking2018.html#session-7][Bringing the Power of eBPF to Open vSwitch]]
 - *TC eBPF*, (re)implemented OVS in eBPF (performance limited)
 - *Offloading subset to XDP* (issue: missing some BPF helpers)
 - *AF_XDP*, huge performance gain

* Slide: AF_XDP                                                      :export:

How can *kernel-bypass* solutions use AF_XDP as a /building block/?


** Slide: AF_XDP integration with DPDK                              :export:

*AF_XDP poll-mode driver for DPDK*
 - [[https://patches.dpdk.org/project/dpdk/list/?series=1000&state=%2a][RFC patchset]] for AF_XDP PMD-driver sent on DPDK-mailing list by Intel
 - ~1% overhead

Advantages:
 - Don't monopolize entire NIC
 - Split traffic to kernel with XDP filter program
 - HW independent application binary
 - Isolation and robustness
 - Cloud-native support
 - Fewer setup restrictions


** Slide: AF_XDP integration with VPP                               :export:

VPP (FD.io) *could* integrate via AF_XDP DPDK PMD
 - But VPP uses only user-mode driver of DPDK
 - VPP has a lot of native functionality
A native AF_XDP driver would be more efficient
 - Less code and easier setup without DPDK


** Slide: AF_XDP integration with Snabb Switch                      :export:

[[https://github.com/snabbco/snabb/blob/master/README.md][Snabb Switch]]
- Implement an *AF_XDP driver?*
- Allow leveraging kernel drivers that implement XDP
  * Kernel community takes care of maintaining driver code
- Any *performance loss/gap* to native Snabb driver *?*
  * E.g. NAPI "only" bulk up-to 64 packets
  * E.g. NAPI is not doing busy-polling 100%, more latency variance


* Slide: Ongoing work                                                :export:

 - Upstreaming performance optimizations
 - XDP programs per queue
 - Libbpf: facilitating adoption
 - Packet clone for XDP


* Slide: Summary                                                     :export:

 - /XDP/ = Linux /kernel/ fast path
 - *AF_XDP* = packets to *user space* from /XDP/
 - DPDK speeds
 - A /building block/ for a solution. Not a ready solution in itself.
 - Many upcoming use cases,
   - e.g., OVS, XDP-offload netstack, DPDK PMD
 - Come join the fun!

** Slide: Where does AF_XDP performance come from?                  :export:

/Lock-free [[https://lwn.net/Articles/169961/][channel]] directly from driver RX-queue into AF_XDP socket/
- Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) descriptor ring queues
- *Single*-/Producer/ (SP) via bind to specific RX-*/queue id/*
  * NAPI-softirq assures only 1-CPU process 1-RX-queue id (per sched)
- *Single*-/Consumer/ (SC) via 1-Application
- *Bounded* buffer pool (UMEM) allocated by userspace (register with kernel)
  * Descriptor(s) in ring(s) point into UMEM
  * /No memory allocation/, but return frames to UMEM in timely manner
- [[http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/vj/lca06vj.pdf][Transport signature]] Van Jacobson talked about
  * Replaced by XDP/eBPF program choosing to XDP_REDIRECT

** Slide: Details: Actually *four* SPSC ring queues                 :export:

AF_XDP /socket/: Has /two rings/: *RX* and *TX*
 - Descriptor(s) in ring points into UMEM
/UMEM/ consists of a number of equally sized chunks
 - Has /two rings/: *FILL* ring and *COMPLETION* ring
 - FILL ring: application gives kernel area to RX fill
 - COMPLETION ring: kernel tells app TX is done for area (can be reused)

** Slide: Gotcha by RX-queue id binding                             :export:

AF_XDP bound to */single RX-queue id/* (for SPSC performance reasons)
- NIC by default spreads flows with RSS-hashing over RX-queues
  * Traffic likely not hitting queue you expect
- You *MUST* configure NIC *HW filters* to /steer to RX-queue id/
  * Out of scope for XDP setup
  * Use ethtool or TC HW offloading for filter setup
- *Alternative* work-around
  * /Create as many AF_XDP sockets as RXQs/
  * Have userspace poll()/select on all sockets
