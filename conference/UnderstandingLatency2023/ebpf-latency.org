#+begin_quote
eBPF is a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed programs in the Linux
kernel without changing kernel source code or loading a kernel module

*Rate of innovation* at the operating system level: */Traditionally slow/*
 - eBPF enables things at the OS level that were not possible before
 - eBPF can /radically increase/ rate of innovation

** Slide: *Traditional* Kernel development process                :noexport:

** Slide: *eBPF* development process                              :noexport:

* Slide: eBPF components                                             :export:

Closer look at the eBPF components:

 - /Bytecode/ - Architecture independent *Instruction Set*
   * /JIT/ to native machine instructions (after loading into kernel)

 - /Runtime environment/ - Linux kernel
   * *Event based* BPF hooks all over the kernel
   * Per hook limited access to kernel functions via *helpers and kfuncs*

 - /*Sandboxed*/ by the eBPF /verifier/
   * Limits and verifies memory access and instructions limit

* Slide: What is XDP?                                                :export:

XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a Linux *in-kernel* fast path
 - /Programmable layer in front/ of the kernel networking stack
   - Read, modify, drop, redirect or pass
   - For L2-L3 use cases: seeing /x10 performance/ improvements!
 - *Avoiding* /memory allocations/
 - Adaptive *bulk* processing of frames
 - Very /early access/ to frame (in driver code *after DMA sync*)
 - Ability to */skip/ (large parts) of kernel /code/*

** Slide: XDP performance                                           :export:

*XDP_DROP*: 100Gbit/s mlx5 max out at /108 Mpps/ (CPU E5-1650v4 @3.60GHz)

* Lower latency with eBPF                                            :export:

eBPF can help improve latency in a number of ways

- Lower latency by increasing PPS performance
- Custom software RSS steering
- Passive latency monitoring
- Future: Queueing for XDP

** Scaling a latency-reducing traffic shaper                        :export:

*Use case*: ISP middlebox providing per-customer bandwidth enforcement and
bufferbloat mitigation (using kernel queueing infrastructure)

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: Software shaping doesn't scale because of *global qdisc lock*

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: XDP can choose which CPU to start the Linux networking stack on -
steer a subset of customers to each CPU, so CPUs can run independently
(avoiding the lock contention)

https://github.com/LibreQoE/LibreQoS

** Passive latency monitoring                                       :export:

*Use case*: Monitor TCP traffic and extract flow latency (using TCP timestamps)
to passively monitor traffic flowing through a middlebox.

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: The existing solution in software ([[https://github.com/pollere/pping][pping]]) doesn't scale to high
bandwidths

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: eBPF can inspect every packet with very low overhead - implement
the monitoring in the kernel with eBPF, only export metrics to userspace

#+HTML: <br />

https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/tree/master/pping

** Lower latency by increasing PPS performance

*Use case*: Linux-based servers exposed to the internet with high-speed NICs.

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking in NIC RX rings causes latency and
packet drops if kernel can't keep up with flow rate.

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: Implement filtering and redirection in XDP, allowing the kernel to
keep up with the incoming packet rate.

#+HTML: <br />

Ex: https://blog.cloudflare.com/l4drop-xdp-ebpf-based-ddos-mitigations/

** Future: Queueing for XDP
*Use case*: High-performance forwarding path with XDP "software offload"

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: XDP currently has no support for packet queueing and scheduling

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: We're working on adding programmable queueing support to XDP

* Closing remarks                                                    :export:

eBPF allows /unprecedented visibility/ into the OS, and *safe, dynamic
extensibility* of core OS features, networking in particular.
