#+Title: NetConf 2023

Last conference [[http://vger.kernel.org/netconf2019.html][Netconf 2019]] (delayed due to Covid19).

* Description from NetConf 2019

Netconf is a Linux community conference, by-invitation-only, running since 2004.
The agenda has a clear focus on kernel level networking. Attendees are the main
maintainers and developers of the Linux networking subsystem.

Due to the distributed nature of the Network subsystem development, contributors
to the stack are located in different corners of the globe and coordinate
security and bug fixes as well as maintanance and new features via email.

Netconf is intended to be a face to face working meetup to compliment those
email exchanges. Problematic unresolved issues are hashed out and bold new ideas
are discussed.
